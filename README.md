# Welcome to GreatReads!

GreatReads is a book-finding web application which leverages the [Open Library API](http://openlibrary.org/developers/api) to allow users to discover new books by searching by Title, Author, or IBSN.

## User Stories

New users to the site will be greeted by the Login Page.  They will be invited to login to the site with their credentials, or to click on Sign Up to create a new account.

After account creation and login, users will be able to search the Open Library database by typing into the search bar.  The search will return relevant books by Author, Title, or ISBN.  These search results (up to a maximum of 20) will populate at the bottom of the search page, and display some key information about the books.

Users can click on a book's title to bring up a details page, showing additional details about the book including info about Locations, Times, and subjects.  The details page will have a link which adds this particular book to the user's private library.

A Navbar at the top of the page will allow navigation to other pages, including My Library.

Manage your library by adding new books or removing books you don't like anymore.  Read and leave Reviews and Ratings for books in your library.  Edit (Update) or Delete any reviews you've already written.
