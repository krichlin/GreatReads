## User Stories

As a User, I can:
* Securely Create a new account
* Search for Books on OpenLibrary's API
* Save Books to My Library
* View and edit my account info, or delete my account. 
* Post new reviews for books, and see all the reviews I've written.
* Edit or Remove reviews I've written

New users to the site will be greeted by the Login Page.  They will be invited to login to the site with their credentials, or to click on Sign Up to create a new account.

After account creation and login, users will be able to search the Open Library database by typing into the search bar.  The search will return relevant books by Author, Title, or ISBN.  These search results (up to a maximum of 20) will populate at the bottom of the search page, and display some key information about the books.

Users can click on a book's title to bring up a details page, showing additional details about the book including info about Locations, Times, and subjects.  The details page will have a link which adds this particular book to the user's private library.

A Navbar at the top of the page will allow navigation to other pages, including My Library.

Manage your library by adding new books or removing books you don't like anymore.  Read and leave Reviews and Ratings for books in your library.  Edit (Update) or Delete any reviews you've already written.

## Project Notes

GreatReads began as a final capstone project for Flatiron School's Full Time Software Engineering course.
It is written by Ken Richlin with the help of his teachers and advisors at Flatiron.  This project is not
yet 100% complete, however all the current features are functional.  I have many ideas on how to improve
the user's experience, and hope to bring you more functionality soon!

as the purpose of the project is to continue to increase my programming skills.
